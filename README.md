# CompareModels_TRECQA
In a QA system that needs to infer from unstructured corpus, one challenge is to choose the sentence that contains best answer information for the given question.

These files provide six baseline models, i.e. average pooling, RNN, CNN, RNNCNN, QA-LSTM/CNN+attention (Tan, 2015; state-of-art 2015), AP-LSTM/CNN (Santos, 2016; state-of-art 2016) for the TrecQA task (wang et al. 2007).

Model Comparison
----------------
All models were trained on train-all using Keras 2.1.2.  
You can download the glove parameters at here http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip  
Batch normalization was used to improve the performance of the models over the results of the pasky's experiments.
